# 1. Identify patterns

Identify one of the 7 service patterns across our services.

## Check something
[Check something](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/overview) helps users look up information and check whether it applies to them. When there’s an application which depends on eligibility, this should happen in this pattern rather than in the 'apply for something' pattern.

The scenarios we've developed are:

* [check before you apply](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-before-you-apply/overview)

The scenario still to be developed is:

* [check to understand something](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/check-something/check-to-understand-something/overview)

## Apply for something
[Apply for something](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/overview) helps users to complete an application process. Where there is eligibility criteria before an application, this will be found in the 'check something' pattern.
