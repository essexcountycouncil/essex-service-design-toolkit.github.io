# Apply for something
The 'apply for something' pattern allows a user to receive or access a service. When applying for a service, the service is responsible for authorising an outcome for the user.  

The user will follow the 'check something' pattern before using the ‘apply for something’ pattern.

Applications ask for personal and sensitive information, so we must keep the information safe and secure.

Think about whether an application is essential to help the decision making practice. 

If there’s no eligibility criteria, then consider moving users to a ‘book’ or ‘register’ pattern to continue their access to a service. 

Follow one of the 5 scenarios under the ‘apply for something’ pattern:

* [apply for a role](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-a-role/overview)
* [apply for grant](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-a-grant/overview)
* [apply for permission to do something myself](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-permission-to-do-something-myself/overview)
* [apply for something we do](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-for-something-we-do/overview)
* [apply to appeal a decision](/common-service-patterns/service-patterns/apply-for-something/apply-to-appeal-a-decision/overview)
